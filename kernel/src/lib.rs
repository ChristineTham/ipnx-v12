//! The IPNX kernel.
//!
//! What it is, in Christine's words rather than a paraphrase of them — the
//! quotes are in [`docs/verbatim.md`](../../docs/verbatim.md), which is the
//! only part of this repository's documentation that is hers:
//!
//! > *"we are essentially implementing a micro kernel based on a subset of
//! > Plan 9, we should not be adding to it (even the Unix v10 personality
//! > should be userspace) … It is important to keep our kernel pure otherwise
//! > we will encounter serious issues extending the kernel"*
//!
//! > *"The kernel only handles process orchestration. everything else is
//! > handled by host or userspace. Everytime you design a change to the
//! > kernel, the design is wrong."*
//!
//! > *"Actual deviations from Plan 9 kernel are only authorised when it is to
//! > do with adapting it for WASM and WASI"* … *"even then it should be done
//! > in a machine independent way as we may want a non WASM kernel in the
//! > future … for example, dis, or .NET CLR"*
//!
//! And as of 2026-09-17: **every deviation needs her approval, and the default
//! answer is no.** The substrate argument above is hers, but it is a reason to
//! bring her, not a test to pass alone.
//!
//! So: processes, the three tables they own, the namespace, and the channels
//! between them. A console, a clock, a store, a window system are not here —
//!
//! > *"Only saranos knows about the host… I am a macOS app. I have a screen, a
//! > keyboard and a mouse. I will serve these as virtual devices to the IPNX
//! > kernel, which I am going to start."*
//!
//! — the host serves them, over 9P, because *"9P is the only protocol"*. The
//! kernel consumes what it is served and knows nothing about what serves it:
//! *"`/dev/draw` should be rendered by host. the kernel does not know how to
//! draw."*
